Merge multiple excel files - workbook sheets into a single new file and sheet. This is all done via a vba macro. This is helpful for excel tasks, reporting, SQL importation and other things.

I have created a Guide.pdf file to step you through the usage of the "Final Generator via Macro.xlsm" which contains the Macro.
